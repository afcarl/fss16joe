# Some Code Smells Have a Significant but Small Effect on Faults 
For Ase16 Week 5

## Paper

2014 - "Some code smells have a significant but small effect on faults" T Hall, M Zhang, D Bowes, Y Sun - ACM Transactions on Software , 2014 

Cited 24 times

## Key Words
 
ii1 Bad Code Smells - particular structures in code that can cause detrimental effects on software and should be refactored

ii2 Confounding Factor - In statistics, a confounding variable (also confounding factor, a confound, a lurking variable or a confounder) is an extraneous variable in a statistical model that correlates (directly or inversely) with both the dependent variable and the independent variable, in a way that "explains away" some or all of the correlation between these two variables.

## Notes

iii1 Top of page 2 is a good list of previous studies in the same area.

iii2 This author's previous paper  [Zhang et al. 2011] of all 39 studies of smells published between 2000-2009

iii3 The reasons for the lack of research attention are difficult to establish but seem to be partially related to the ease with which smells can be automatically identified in code. 

iii4 Page 3 and 4 "These findings suggest that size is an important confounding factor"

iii5 Hypothsis- Data Clumps,  Middle Man, Speculative Generality, Switch Statements, Message Chain, and file size have no effect (on its own or in combination) on numbers of faults found in files.

## Improvements and Connections

iv1 This paper is dense with references to other papers, not only in the beginning, but throughout.  I suspect that means it is well-researched, but I'm curious if it means it's a good paper.

iv2 The only tool they used to detect 3 smless was Stench Blossem, and the other two smells had to be detected by hand.
